"""Launcher: ``python -m bookwriter.serve``.

Runs uvicorn on 127.0.0.1:8000 (override via BOOKWRITER_HOST / BOOKWRITER_PORT)
serving ``bookwriter.server.create_app()``. Keep heavy imports inside main() so
this module stays cheap to import.

The app has **no authentication** and keeps all live state (the SSE broker, the
one-job-per-book lock, the settings store) in process memory, so:
  * it binds 127.0.0.1 by default and refuses a non-local bind unless you set
    BOOKWRITER_ALLOW_REMOTE=1 (put an auth proxy + TLS in front first); and
  * it must run as a SINGLE process — do not start it under multiple uvicorn/
    gunicorn workers, which would split the in-memory state across processes.
